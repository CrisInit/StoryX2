It's that feeling - pulse quickening, butterflies swarming frantically, flowers blooming, 
  an explosion of colors and soft, alluring scents, anticipation building up - a blank page with a newly sharpened pencil - oh, the feeling of beginingAnew.

This is a story, a story of spring descending upon the frozen, chilled ground of winter-soon-to-pass.
